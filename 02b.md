# Revisions and the Cloud

## Version Control

Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. By utilizing a Version Control System (VCS), mistakes with files can easily be rectified.

### Types of Version Control

* Local Version Control
* Centralized Version Control
* Distributed Version Control

Some types of version control stores changes inside a local machine (user's machine) and some allow the user to store the version in a cloud.
It can help the developers who work on the same project to view each other's work for the project they are working on so that they can work as a team without conflicting each others work.

## What is Git?

Git is one of the version control types which is the Distributed Version Control.
It stores changes to a cloud which prevents any loss of data or connections.
