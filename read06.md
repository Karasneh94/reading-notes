# HTML & CSS

## What is CSS?

Every displayed HTML tag is shown inside its box in the browser, normally this box is represented without styling or colors, CSS is the method of styling each box based on how we want that box of elements to be displayed.

CSS adds a set of rules to each HTML to tell the browser how we want that HTML element to be shown.
A CSS rule contains two parts:

1. Selector
1. Declaration

There are two ways of declaring a CSS code:
1)External CSS
2)Internal CSS

CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.

## Coloring in CSS

### Color Property

The color property allows you
to specify the color of text inside
an element. You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:

* RGB Values
* HEX Codes
* Color Names

### Background Color Property

CSS treats each HTML element
as if it appears in a box, and the
background-color property
sets the color of the background
for that box.

It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).
X CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
X CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.

## JavaScript Functions

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
