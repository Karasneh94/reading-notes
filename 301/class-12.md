# EJS PARTIALS

Partials can be re-used multiple times as they work as a template, for example you can create a header and a footer templates
using EJS partials and then include the .ejs into the home page.

ejs values and syntax are surrounded by `<% %>`, inside of it can be a javascript code or HTML syntax.

ejs stands for Embedded Javascript Templating and its a templating engine used by Node.js. Template engine helps to create an HTML template with minimal code. Also, it can inject data into HTML template at the client side and produce the final HTML.
