# DATABASE NORMALIZATION

Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns.  The main idea with this is that a table should be about a specific topic and only supporting topics included.

By limiting a table to one purpose you reduce the number of duplicate data contained within your database. This eliminates some issues stemming from database modifications.
To achieve these objectives, weâ€™ll use some established rules. As you apply these rules, new tables are formed. The progression from unruly to optimized passes through several normal forms.

## Reasons for Database Normalization
