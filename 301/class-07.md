# APIs continued

The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”. REST provides a definition of a “resource” which the web page is gonna represent them by requesting a specific representation of the resources.

the concept for requesting and reciving the respose is called web services or APIs.

machines can cumunicate with each other by sending API's to each other, the machine translate the API (if needed) to a presentable way for the end user.

Get method in the APIs is used for taking a specific value while there are many other methods like POST, DELETE, PATCH and PUT, each one of them is responsible for a different task.
