# Structure web pages with HTML

## Process & Design

The first step of creating a new website is to start planning for it before starting to creat it, as it helps a lot in writing its code because everything is clear and in place for the developer.

the very first steps in planning is that you should be able to answer these questions :

1. who is gonna be using the website?
1. why they are visiting it?
1. what kind of actions they are gonna perform in your website?
1. what kind of information your visitors are gonna need?
1. how often users will visit the website?
1. Is your website information organaized into sections and pages that the expected users can understand?
1. Does your Wireframe includes all of the information that needs to be on the page?
1. Is your website's design focuses on organizing and proritizing information on the pages?
1. Does your website follows the visual hierarchy rules?
1. Did you group related pieces of information together?
1. Is your website's Navigation concise, clear and selective?

## Structure

Every kind of document needs to be structured in a way that makes it easer for the reader to read and notice important elements in the document, so in websites development we use HTML to structure a webpage by using HTML tags to make it look better and straight to the point

## HTML5 Layout

HTML5 is the latest version of HTML which helps the developer to structure their website in a better way.

HTML5 has new elements that are not provided by older versions, these new elements are very understandable since they are writtin in a high end language.

some older browserd doesnt support HTML5 so to avoid any conflict we need to add some CSS to tell the out-dated browser that any unsuported element should be displayed as a block-level element.

## Extra Markup

* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.
* You can add comments to your code between the <!-- and --> markers.
* The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.
* The '<div>' and '<span>' elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
* '<iframes>' cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
* The '<meta>' tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.
* Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.
