## Comparison and logical operators

### Evaluating Conditions (Comparison)

We can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be.
It always gonna return a boolean

### Logical Operators

So logical operators allows us to compare two comparison operators, as we know comparison operators always returns a True or False, so in this case we will be comparing between true and false.

#### Types of Logical Operators

* Logical AND &&
* Logical OR ||
* Logical NOT !

## Loops

Loops can be used to repeat a block of code as many times as a condition is returning true.

### Types of Loops

* For Loop
* While Loop
* Do While Loop

Each one has a unique syntax and each one are used in different situation.
One of the common mistakes in using loops is that the condition might never return a false so the loop will get stuck and repeat the same block of code until forever, and we call that as an infinity Loop.
